## Description

the creation of REST API.

## Challenge

Favs is a new company that aims to provide a better way to organize your
favorite things: music, clothes, courses, etc., all in one place.

The CEO of Favs hired you to develop the initial version of his product. Itâ€™s
worth mentioning that she does not have any technical background.

However, she has a clear vision on how the product should behave, so she
provided a list of functional requirements.

## Requirements

1. Each user will have a unique id, and he will authenticate using a non-empty
email and a password.
2. Each user will be able to save a list of favs. Each fav will have an title,
description and link, and each list will be defined by a unique id and a name.
3. The system have to allow the following actions:
  - Create a new list with a given name (auto-generate the unique id)
  - Get the users lists
  - Get an individual list for the user
  - Add items to a given list (based on the generated id)
  - All endpoints have to be secured with Bearer Auth (JWT)
  - You should ensure that the password is strong enough
